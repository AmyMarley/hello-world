Write a bit about myself - i'm a qualified accountant who ended up becoming a software tester at the gui/manual level by default. Its an interesting an ongoing journey/process accepting/creating a calm to my accounting brain, where everything must reconcile and balance with the infinite testing possibilties and everchanging development/tech world!
